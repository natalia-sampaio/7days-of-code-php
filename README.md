## About this project:

- day 1: I was presented with an unfinished project that did not follow the good practices that the market adopts, so I refactored small code snippets to have low coupling and high cohesion.
- day 2: Created new files and functions to save the data submitted by the user in the registration form without using the database.
- day 3: Validated the user's data and, if there is any error in the form, the request must go back to the previous screen and an error message must be displayed.
- day 4: Add the send a registration confirmation email to new users feature. Create an email account and mess with the SSL encrypted token.
- day 5: Retrieve the information that was encrypted using SSL, in addition to allowing the user to be able to log in to ScubaPHP after activating the account.
- day 6: Generate the home page dynamically with the data of the logged in user, develop the functionality to delete data and activate the logout button.
- day 7: Last tweak: the change password flow. Created two unauthenticated routes and they will be responsible for handling incoming requests.
